There's a lot of variations for this with different whiskey types, but rye whiskey is the one to go for, although bourbon can also be used. If you've ever tried this with scotch (in which case the drink is actually called Rob Roy) and didn't like it, I encourage you to try again with proper ingredients. For drier version, put three parts of whiskey",
