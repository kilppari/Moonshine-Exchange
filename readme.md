Moonshine Exchange

Moonshine Exchange is a project for my personal Android phone for storing
cocktail recipes, images and notes about them.

The app uses internal JSON file for recipe storage and the phone's external
memory card to load possible images from.

This project is a work in progress and currently supports displaying of 
basic cocktail recipes, images and making recipe searches. Custom sorting and new recipe adding is still to 
be implemented. For now, new recipes can only be added by manually updating the
cocktails.json file.
